# Android Messages desktop app for macOS
None of the pieces of this are my original work, I am only the one who glued the individual pieces together. I used [Nativefier](https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier) to wrap [messages.android.com](http://messages.android.com) in an [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) wrapper, and uploaded the result here for the world. I probably won't update it unless something big happens. 

You should be able to just download the zip and run it.

Tested on Windows 10 and macOS Sierra.
